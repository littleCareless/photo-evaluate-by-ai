# Photo evaluate by AI

For a photography beginner, what exactly is their own photography like? What is good, and what is not good? What is good about it? What can be improved? With more shooting, although there may be some blurred feelings, progress will be faster with personal guidance. Such a mentor is actually hard to find. In fact, the requirements are not high; just a mentor who is a level above oneself is enough. At this point, AI is undoubtedly a guide that is a level above the beginner.

As the saying goes, the master leads the door, and the practice is up to the individual. You still have to take more pictures, and after you take them, AI's feedback is enough for beginners at least.
